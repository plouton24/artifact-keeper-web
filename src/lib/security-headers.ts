/**
 * Security response headers for every route (wired into `next.config.ts`'s
 * `async headers()`).
 *
 * Two of these headers only make sense when the deployment actually terminates
 * TLS, and are actively harmful on a plain-HTTP deployment:
 *
 *   - `Strict-Transport-Security` (HSTS)
 *   - the `upgrade-insecure-requests` CSP directive
 *
 * On the common first-run default deployment (`http://<IP>:30080`, no TLS),
 * `upgrade-insecure-requests` makes the browser rewrite every same-origin
 * request from http:// to https://. Port 30080 only serves plain HTTP, so the
 * upgraded `https://<IP>:30080/*.js` requests fail to connect and the whole UI
 * becomes inaccessible. See artifact-keeper/artifact-keeper#2222.
 *
 * These two are therefore gated behind an explicit opt-in
 * (`AK_ENFORCE_HTTPS`), default OFF, so a plain-HTTP default deploy works out
 * of the box while real TLS deployments keep the hardening.
